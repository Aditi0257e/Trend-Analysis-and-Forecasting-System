Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/sayantani-12/unified_trend_driven_personalization_and_forecasting_system.git
cd unified_trend_driven_personalization_and_forecasting_system
Create a virtual environment:
 python -m venv venv
 source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install additional dependencies:
pip install selenium statsmodels matplotlib
Set up ChromeDriver: Download the ChromeDriver that matches your Chrome browser version. Move the downloaded chromedriver to a directory that's in your system's PATH, or specify the path in your script as follows:
from selenium import webdriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path='/path/to/chromedriver')
Making a CSV File Here is a simple script to create a CSV file:
import csv

 data = [
 ['Name', 'Age', 'City'],
 ['Alice', 30, 'New York'],
 ['Bob', 25, 'San Francisco'],
 ['Charlie', 35, 'Los Angeles']
 ]

 with open('user_name.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
   writer = csv.writer(file)
   writer.writerows(data)
Run the above script to generate a user_name.csv file with your sample data.
